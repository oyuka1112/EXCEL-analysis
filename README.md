## Analysis and Challenges
- Analysis: 
   - In the Theater Outcomes on Launch Date sheet:
      - Created pivot table from the original dataset
      - Used filters on "Parent category" and "Years" columns
      - "Parent Category" is filtered on theater
      - Created line chart that illustrates if the theater crowdfunding was successful, failed, or canceled by what month it was launched. 
    - In the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet:
      - Used COUNTIFS() function to get the number of "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns, based on the project "outcome," the "goal" amount using the goal ranges in Step 3, and the Subcategory "plays"
      - Calculated the percentage rate of successful, failed, and canceled projects
      - Created the line chart that illustrates the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis, the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis
  - :thought_balloon: First challenge is that I needed to look at how to change a title for the pivot table's chart. I looked at the Excel documentation and found out how to change it.
  - :thought_balloon: Second challenge is that I needed to get emoji for the README file, so I looked at [the Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).
  - :thought_balloon: Any other possible challenges that could come up, I will definetily search [Google](https://google.com), [Excel documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel), and [Github README documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
## Results

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
